# T_Price_WEB601Assignments_GamingFranchises
 A project based on my favourite gaming franchises

Name: Terry Price

First assignment:   created Content interface, content-list class, content-card component
                    implemented content list with 3 items, used functions in content list
                    class to display items on page through content-list.component.html file

Second assignment:  removed content-list helper file, created content-list component, implemented
                    6 items into a content-list array within its constructor, used *ngFor to display
                    5 array items on page and styled each element with the first item having a thicker
                    border. Added function that would log image title and id to the console when clicked.
                    Added code which would allow tags, imageurl, or type properties to not be shown if 
                    they weren't set.
